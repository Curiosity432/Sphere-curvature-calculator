# Earth curvature calculator
To calculate the curvature of the Earth, there are various methods

## 1. Pitagoras Theorem

## 2. Perimeter of a circle
## 3. Using trigonometry

# Spherical Earth model scheme
- Data:
	- Î±: angle variation
	- d: distance AB
	- h: observer's hidden DB height
	- R: radius of the spherical Earth (R=6371 Km=3959 mi)
- Points:
	- A: observer on the edge of the sphere
	- B: vertical prolongation of the object at D
	- C: center of the circle
	- D: base of the hidden object
